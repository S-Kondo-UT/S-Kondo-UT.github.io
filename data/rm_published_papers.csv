Here we report a three-dimensional porous metal-organic crystal, which is exceptional in that its warps and wefts are connected only by catenation. This porous crystal is composed of a tetragonal lattice and dynamically changes its geometry upon guest molecule release, uptake and exchange, and also upon temperature variation even in a low temperature range. We indented(4) the crystal along its a/b axes and obtained the Young's moduli of 1.77 +/- 0.16 GPa in N,N-dimethylformamide and 1.63 +/- 0.13 GPa in tetrahydrofuran, which are the lowest among those reported so far for porous metal-organic crystals(5). To our surprise, hydrostatic compression showed that this elastic porous crystal was the most deformable along its c axis, where 5% contraction occurred without structural deterioration upon compression up to 0.88 GPa. The crystal structure obtained at 0.46 GPa showed that the catenated macrocycles move translationally upon contraction. We anticipate our mechanically interlocked molecule-based design to be a starting point for the development of porous materials with exotic mechanical properties. For example, squeezable porous crystals that may address an essential difficulty in realizing both high abilities of guest uptake and release are on the horizon.A rubber-like, metal-organic crystal is reported with a mechanically interlocked catenane backbone, which could allow for easy guest molecule uptake and release.",null,"NATURE PORTFOLIO",2021-10,null,NATURE,598,7880,298,+,eng,null,null,scientific_journal,null,null,10.1038/s41586-021-03880-x,0028-0836,1476-4687,null,null,false,disclosed

The synthesis was conducted without traditional reductants and Pd-precursors are reduced by NaOL. It was confirmed that the alkyl double bond in NaOL is not the only explanation for the reduction of Pd-precursors since Pd NPs could be synthesized with CTAC and the saturated fatty acid sodium stearate (NaST). A quantitative evaluation of the reduction kinetics using UV-Vis spectroscopy shows that Pd NPs synthesized with both stabilizer combinations follow pseudo first-order reaction kinetics, where NaOL provides a faster and more effective reduction of Pd-precursors.

These grain boundary fractures proceed by the atomic-bond rupture within the grain boundary cores, and thus grain boundary structures have crucial influence on the fracture properties. However, the relationship between grain boundary structures and atomic fracture processes has been a matter of conjecture, especially in the case of dopant-segregated grain boundaries which have complicated local structures and chemistries. Here, we determine the atomic-bond breaking path within a dopant-segregated Al2O3 grain boundary core, via atomic-scale observations of the as-fractured surface and the crack tip introduced by in situ nanoindentation experiments inside a transmission electron microscope. Our observations show that the atomic fracture path is selected to produce less coordination-deficient oxygen polyhedra of dopant cations, which is rationalised using first-principles calculations. The present findings indicate that the atomic coordination geometry at the grain boundary core affects the fracture processes.",null,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP",2019-05,null,"NATURE COMMUNICATIONS",10,null,null,null,eng,null,null,scientific_journal,null,null,10.1038/s41467-019-10183-3,2041-1723,null,null,null,false,disclosed

A 60 degrees mixed basal dislocation was preferentially introduced by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) nanoindentation, and characterized by atomic-resolution scanning TEM (STEM). It was revealed that the 60 degrees mixed basal dislocation dissociates into two partial dislocations via self-climb with a stacking fault on the {1 (1) over bar 00} plane. The dissociation mechanisms of the basal dislocation have been discussed in terms of its core structure and atomic diffusion process. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It has been considered that grain boundaries act as effective barriers for dislocation glide, but the origin of this barrier-like behavior has been a matter of conjecture for many years. We directly observe how the motion of individual dislocations is impeded at well-defined high-angle and low-angle grain boundaries in SrTiO3, via in situ nano-indentation experiments inside a transmission electron microscope. Our in situ observations show that both the high-angle and low-angle grain boundaries impede dislocation glide across them and that the impediment of dislocation glide does not simply originate from the geometric effects; it arises as a result of the local structural stabilization effects at grain boundary cores as well, especially for low-angle grain boundaries. The present findings indicate that simultaneous consideration of both the geometric effects and the stabilization effects is necessary to quantitatively understand the dislocation impediment processes at grain boundaries.",null,"AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE",2016-11,null,"SCIENCE ADVANCES",2,11,null,null,eng,null,null,scientific_journal,null,null,10.1126/sciadv.1501926,2375-2548,null,null,null,false,disclosed

The plastic deformation of SrTiO3 was found to proceed by dislocation slips even at room temperatures under the present experimental condition, and the dynamic behavior of dislocations such as nucleation, propagation, and annihilation have been clearly captured. The detailed dislocation analyses revealed that the activated slip system is < 110 >{1 (1) over bar0} type, which is consistent with the results of macroscopic deformation experiments reported so far. The mechanisms of dislocation behavior are discussed based on the experimentally obtained results. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.
