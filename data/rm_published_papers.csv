The process involved regulating Joule heating in the samples by fine-tuning the input power through an alternating current field (nominal current density: 50 mA·mm−2) within a 3-min timeframe at a furnace temperature of 1100°C. This approach effectively enhanced grain size uniformity, which is crucial for preventing sample cracking associated with spontaneous tetragonal-to-monoclinic (T→M) phase transformation, thereby promoting densification with average relative densities exceeding 99%. The highest average fracture toughness of the 1.5YSZ samples was measured at 9.2 MPa·m0.5 using the standardized single-edge pre-cracked beam method. This toughness is approximately double that of commonly used 3YSZ samples produced by CRF sintering, all of which exhibited comparable average grain sizes and relative densities. Additionally, the 1.5YSZ samples demonstrated nearly identical resistance to low-temperature degradation (LTD) compared to the 3YSZ samples after accelerated hydrothermal aging at 140°C for 15 h, roughly equivalent to 60 years at 37°C. The reduced yttria concentration in 1.5YSZ facilitates T→M phase transformation at lower stress thresholds, enhancing toughness through increased crack shielding from a larger volume fraction of transformed grains. Furthermore, the uniform yttria distribution in 1.5YSZ, revealed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, compensates for the reduced tetragonal phase stability and contributes to improved LTD resistance. Notably, these exceptional properties were achieved at a furnace temperature 300°C lower and with a sintering duration several hours shorter than those of conventionally-sintered counterparts.",null,null,2025-01-15,null,"Acta Materialia",283,null,null,null,null,null,null,scientific_journal,null,null,10.1016/j.actamat.2024.120496,1359-6454,null,null,null,false,disclosed

Atomic‐resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization requires precise tilting of the specimen to a high symmetric zone axis, which is usually processed in reciprocal space by following the diffraction patterns. However, for small‐sized nanocrystalline materials, their diffraction patterns are often too faint to guide the tilting process. Here, a simple and effective tilting method is developed based on the diffraction contrast change of the shadow image in the Ronchigram. The misorientation angle of the specimen can be calculated and tilted to the zone axis based on the position of the shadow image with lowest intensity. This method requires no prior knowledge of the sample and the maximum misorientation angle that can be corrected is &gt;±6.9° with sub‐mrad accuracy. It operates in real space, without recording the diffraction patterns of the specimens, making it particularly effective for nanocrystalline materials. Combined with the scripting to control the microscope, the sample can be automatically tilted to the zone axis under low dose conditions (&lt;0.17 e<sup>−</sup> Å<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), facilitating the imaging of beam sensitive materials such as zeolites or metal‐organic frameworks.

In this study, we focused on hexagonal (h-) HoFeO3, which is an intriguing multiferroic material that exhibits room-temperature ferroelectricity, an antiferromagnetic (AFM)-to-weak-ferromagnetic (wFM) phase transition, and strong magnetoelectric coupling. We fabricated h-HoFeO3 films on an Al2O3(001) substrate with a hexagonal structure. Initially, we expected the a- and c-axes of the film to align parallel to the [100]Al2O3 or [120]Al2O3 directions and the out-of-plane direction, respectively. However, our investigation revealed an unusual crystal orientation: the a-axis of the film was tilted by +5° or −5° relative to the [120]Al2O3 direction, while the c-axis remained parallel to the out-of-plane direction. This unique orientation was stabilized by a large-period lattice matching between the film and substrate. Plan-view transmission electron microscopy measurements indicated that the grain boundaries formed by the two grain types possessed a new cation network.

The electron mobility value of 320cm2V-1s-1 observed from La-doped BaSnO3 (LBSO) single crystals has a great potential in optoelectronic applications, but LBSO films exhibit much lower mobilities. Threading dislocations from the film/substrate mismatch are believed to be the main source of this phenomenon, but previous experiments suggest that they do not fully explain the mobility suppression. In this paper, we examined the thickness dependence of electrical and thermal transport properties of LBSO films fabricated in different oxidation environments. The results show that oxygen deficiency also affects the electron mobility of LBSO films, and the mobility suppression in LBSO films is dominated by different mechanisms depending on the thicknesses. LBSO films with different oxygen vacancy contents were fabricated using the pulsed laser deposition technique. The films deposited under higher oxidative conditions exhibited lower oxygen deficiency levels and superior transport properties whereas the threading dislocation densities remained unchanged.

La-Doped BaSnO3 (LBSO) is one of the most promising transparent oxide semiconductors because its single crystal exhibits high electron mobility; therefore, it has drawn significant attention in recent years. However, in the LBSO films, it is very hard to obtain high mobility due to threading dislocations, which are caused by the lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate. While previous studies have reported that insertion of buffer layers increases the electron mobilities; this approach leaves much to be desired since it involves a two-step film fabrication process, and the enhanced mobility values are still significantly lower than the single crystal values. Thus, herein, we show that the electron mobility of the LBSO films can be improved without the insertion of any buffer layers if the films are grown under highly oxidative ozone (O3) atmospheres. The O3 environment relaxes the LBSO lattice and reduces the formation of the Sn2+ states, which are known to suppress the electron mobility in LBSO.

Copper oxide nanowires with varying oxidation states are prepared and their activity for water oxidation is studied. The nanowires with a CuO phase are found to be the most active, and their degree of crystallinity is important in achieving efficient water oxidation. For the crystalline CuO nanowires in a weakly basic Na2CO3 electrolyte, a Tafel slope of 41 mV/decade, an overpotential of approximately 500 mV at ~ 10 mA/cm2 (without compensation for the solution resistance), and a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100% are obtained. This electrode maintains a stable current for over 15 h. The low overpotential of 500 mV at 10 mA/cm2, small Tafel slope, long-term stability, and low cost make CuO one of the most promising catalysts for water oxidation.

The atomic structures and oxygen vacancy concentrations in individual GBs are obtained by electron microscopy and theoretical calculations at atomic scale. Meanwhile, local GB oxygen reduction reactivity is measured by electrochemical strain microscopy. By combining these techniques, it is demonstrated that the GB electrochemical activities are affected by the oxygen vacancy concentrations, which is, on the other hand, determined by the local structural distortions at the GB core region.

For the PZT films with mixed textures, residual compressive stress and tensile stress coexist in the films.
