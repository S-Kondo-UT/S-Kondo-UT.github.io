## Research

Lattice defects in materials—such as dislocations, grain boundaries, and interfaces—are crucial in governing a wide range of material phenomena and properties. My research focuses on uncovering nano- and atomic-scale mechanisms using in situ TEM/STEM techniques. My research topics include deformation and fracture, grain growth, grain boundary migration, and phase transformations in metals and ceramics.
